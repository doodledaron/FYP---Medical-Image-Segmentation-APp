# Test Runner Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made to `run_tests.py`

I've enhanced your test runner to ensure that both **learning** and **segmentation** app tests are properly discovered and executed.

## Key Improvements:

### 1. **Explicit App Targeting** 
Previously used wildcard patterns (`*/test_*.py`) which could be unreliable.
Now explicitly targets both apps:

**Before:**
```bash
pytest */test_models.py -v        # May miss some files
pytest */test_views.py -v         # May miss some files
```

**After:**
```bash
pytest learning/test_models.py segmentation/test_models.py -v     # Explicit
pytest learning/test_views.py segmentation/test_views.py -v       # Explicit
```

### 2. **Test File Validation**
Added validation to check that all required test files exist before running:
- âœ… `learning/test_models.py`
- âœ… `learning/test_views.py`
- âœ… `segmentation/test_models.py`
- âœ… `segmentation/test_views.py`

### 3. **New Discovery Command**
Added `discover` command to see what tests will be found:
```bash
python run_tests.py discover
```

### 4. **Improved Coverage Targeting**
Coverage now specifically targets the two apps instead of everything:
```bash
--cov=learning --cov=segmentation
```

### 5. **Better Documentation**
Updated help text to clarify that commands affect both apps.

## Available Commands:

```bash
# Run all tests from both apps
python run_tests.py

# Test only models from both apps  
python run_tests.py models

# Test only views/API from both apps
python run_tests.py views

# Show what tests will be discovered
python run_tests.py discover

# Run with detailed coverage
python run_tests.py coverage

# Run specific test
python run_tests.py specific learning/test_views.py::TestLearningViewSet
```

## Verification:

You can now be confident that when you run:

- **`python run_tests.py models`** â†’ Tests both `learning/test_models.py` AND `segmentation/test_models.py`
- **`python run_tests.py views`** â†’ Tests both `learning/test_views.py` AND `segmentation/test_views.py`
- **`python run_tests.py`** â†’ Tests all files from both apps

## What's Guaranteed:

1. âœ… **Models tested**: Both learning and segmentation model tests will run
2. âœ… **Views tested**: Both learning and segmentation view tests will run  
3. âœ… **File validation**: Script validates files exist before running
4. âœ… **Clear output**: Shows exactly which apps are being tested
5. âœ… **Proper coverage**: Coverage reports target only your app code

The test runner is now robust and explicitly ensures both your learning and segmentation apps are thoroughly tested! ðŸŽ¯
